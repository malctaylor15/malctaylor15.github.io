# Hello 

Hello my name is Malcolm Taylor. This website is designed to help you get to know more about me and my projects.  
Feel free to look at my various projects and please contact me if you have any questions.  

## Stephen Curry / Under Armour Project - R 

In this project, I examine Stephen Curry's performance with his sponsor UnderAromours over night stock return. 
More information about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/malctaylor15/NBA_Project)

## VIX Bayesian - R 

In this project, I examine the stock ticker for the Volatility Index (VIX). I use a Bayesian version of a time series linear regression. 
We aim to obtain predictive posterior distributions for the VIX given weekly data over a 3 year period. 
This project was inspired by an assignment at Boston University. More information can be found [here] (https://github.com/malctaylor15/VIX_Bayesian)

## Abalone Age Project - iPython Notebook 

In this project, I analyze the famous Abalone dataset from the University at California Irivine (UCI). We visualize some of the data and practice data cleaning and running a few machine learning algorithms on the data.
