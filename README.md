# Hello 

Hello! My name is Malcolm Taylor. This website is designed to help you get to know more about me and my projects.  
Feel free to look at my various projects and contact me  at malctaylor15@gmail.com if you have any questions.  

## Song Lyrics NLP Analysis - Python Scripts - 2017   ** in Progress ** 

In this project, my friend [Devin Rose](https://github.com/trackoverxc/) and I use the spotify and genius APIs to get the lyrics for user created playlists. We plan on building word vectors on the playlist as well as applying pretrained representations on the playlist to learn more about the lyrics of the playlist.

## Zillow Z-Estimate Home Value Prediction Project - iPython Notebook - 2017 

In this project, my friend [Devin Rose](https://github.com/trackoverxc/) and I work on the 2017 Kaggle Zillow error prediction competition. The goal of this competition is to predict the difference between Zillow's housing estimate and the sale price of the house given various information about the properties. We clean the data set and apply several machine learning algorithms to generate predictions on the test set. We used practiced using linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks.

## Wine Quality Analysis - iPython Notebook - 2017
In this project, the goal is to predict the quality of wine based on several chemical features. There are two sets of analysis. In one notebook, we try to determine which wines are high quality compared to low quality in a classification setting. We compare a standard logistic regression with a Bayesian logistic regression using pymc3.  
In the other notebook, we examine the quality as a continous regression problem using Random Forest and Linear Regression. We conduct some exploratory data analysis, preprocess the data and run the algorith. We also conduct a random search among the hyper parameters of the Random Forest to find an optimal model without taking too much time.

## SAT Score EDA - R - 2017 

In this project, I conduct Exploratory data analysis on a the 2012 SAT Scores from the 5 boroughs of New York City. More information can be found [here](https://malctaylor15.github.io/NYC_SAT_Scores_2012/)

## Rental List Inquiries by Two Sigma - R -2017 

In this project, I construct several R scripts to explore and create predictions for the rental listings dataset from the Kaggle competition. I use the h2o platform in R to conduct one-vs-all logistic regression and a random search through the hyper parameters of a gradient boosted machine.

## Stock Forecasting using Fundamental Data - R - 2016

This was a group project where we attempted to forecast the monthly return and sign of the return of several public companies. 
The team and I used elastic net regression techniques, random forest and deep neural networks to create an ensemble model.  
This project was a final assignment at Boston University. More information can be found [here](https://malctaylor15.github.io/MF850_Computational_Finance_Final/)

## Stephen Curry / Under Armour Project - R - 2016 

In this project, I examine Stephen Curry's performance with the over night stock return of his corporate sponsor Under Aromour. More information about this project can be found [here](https://malctaylor15.github.io/NBA_Project/)

## VIX Forecasting, Bayesian Monte Carlo Simulation Assignment - R - 2016

In this project, I examine the stock ticker for the Volatility Index (VIX). I use a Bayesian version of a time series linear regression. 
We aim to obtain predictive posterior distributions for the VIX given weekly data over a 3 year period. 
This project was inspired by an assignment at Boston University. More information can be found [here](https://malctaylor15.github.io/VIX_Bayesian/)

## Abalone Age Project - iPython Notebook - 2016 

In this project, I analyze the famous Abalone dataset from the University at California Irivine (UCI). We visualize some of the data and practice data cleaning and running a few machine learning algorithms on the data.
